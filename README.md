# Mining Twitter Data
by Brian Murphy and China Moxey.

## About
For this project, we wanted to become more familar with the Twitter API, tweets, and perform basic analysis using Python. To that end, we followed the [Mining Twitter by Marco Bonzanini] (https://marcobonzanini.com/2015/03/02/mining-twitter-data-with-python-part-1/). 
We learned how to stream tweets,save them into json files, find term co-occurence, and perform basic visualization using graphs and charts. We capped it off using Leafletjs to make a map showing the geo-location of the tweets.

## Libraries used
Tweepy- to access the Twitter API.
Vincent- for data visualization.
Json- to manipulate Json files.
Leafletjs- to make a map of the tweets.
